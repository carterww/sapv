# Display Modes
This program allows users to define custom display modes via specially formatted .json files. Since these are not compiled into the program, the user can define their own whenever they'd like, and it does not take any coding skill to do so. These .json files, however, should be well structured and fit within the guidelines outlined in this document. If the program has an issue reading your display mode, check the log files (TODO: figure out where the log files will go) for more information. If you think it is caused by a bug, feel free to open as issue on Github.
